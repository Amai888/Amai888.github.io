# ABOUT ME

## My Interests

Some of my interests are:
- **Pickleball**: I currently play pickleball with my friends. One of the videos I watched to learn the basics as a beginner was from _The Tennis Express_ on YouTube. [Pickleball video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5RyCh7GNc)

- **Soccer**: I love both watching and playing soccer. My family are true fans of the sport, which got me into it as I grew up. Our favorite team is, of course, **Barcelona**, and our favorite player is **Messi**! I often look up their best plays. One of my favorite videos is this one on YouTube: [Barcelona video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sko8H-7eMCg)

- **Reading**: I read every single day, whether it's on my phone, laptop, or a physical book. My reading spans many different genres, from romance to murder mysteries to manga! Currently, I'm reading _The Art Thief_ by Michael Finkel, which is based on true events!
